    _
4.  **Features List:**  
    _<The list of features are a list of abilities/capabilities that the solution will have. The features are stated from the perspective of the user. An example might be “that the system must provide for on-line entry of all orders”.>  
    _
5.  **System Objectives:**  
    _<System objectives are stated from the perspective of the Information Technology group. An example might be “that all transactions must provide less than 2 seconds response time”.>  
    _
6.  **Project Critical Success Factors:**  
    _<These represent the factors that will make the project a success. An example might be “that a business user is available to the project full time.”>  
    _
7.  **Preliminary Technical Architecture:**

**Event Table Template**

_  
<A catalog of use cases that lists events in rows and key pieces of information about each event in columns. The event table lists the business events that are to be part of the software solution.>_

1. Event - the event that causes the system to do something.

2. Trigger – How does the system know the event occurred? For external events, this is data entering the system. For temporal events, it is a definition of the point in time that triggers the system processing.

3. Source – For external event, the actor is the source of the data. For temporal events, leave it blank.

4. Use Case – What system does when event occurs?

5. Response – Output or result produced by the system.

6. Destination – Agent who gets the output produced.
