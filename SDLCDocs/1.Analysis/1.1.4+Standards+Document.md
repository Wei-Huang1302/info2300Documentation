# Project Coding Standards

## Header Comments

The header comments should include:

*   Filename
*   Class Description
*   Revision History

|Static Object|ALL UPPERCASE|DEPOSIT|
|Method Parameter|camelCase|userName|
|Variable|camelCase|firstName|
|Constant|ALL UPPERCASE|TAX\_RATE|
|Namespace|PascalCase|Property.Basement|
|Property|PascalCase|GetUserName|
|Method|PascalCase|AddUser|
|Enumeration|PascalCase|MyConstant|
|Event|PascalCase|LaunchProgram|
|Database Table|CamelCase|order|
|Database Column|CamelCase|orderID|

## Identifier Formatting

### Object Naming

The object names will be prefixed with the abbreviated name of the type of object. The objects themselves will be named with entire words with no abbreviations

Examples:

*   TextBox – txtFirstName
*   Label – lblFirstName
*   Button – btnGenerate

### Variables/Constants

*   All variables will be created on separate lines
*   All variables will be initialized after they are created, on a separate line
*   All variables should be accessed using properties outside of the class, not directly
*   All constants will be declared globally (class scope)

Examples:

*   string firstName;

firstname=””;

*   int number;
*   number=0;

### Curly Braces

*   All of the code between curly braces should be indented 1 tab space (including nested brackets)
*   All of the curly braces should appear on a separate line
*   All of the content between curly braces should appear on separate lines

### Spacing

*   A blank line should appear before and after a control construct (if, for, while, etc)
*   A blank space should appear after each comma in a comma-separated list
*   A line of code should be split into several lines if it extends further than the code window
*   A space should appear before and after operators such as > < =.

### Methods

*   All method parameters should be of a certain type, not generic like object
*   Any methods that return a value should only have one return statement
*   A single method should fulfill a single task and should not be broad in its purpose
*   Any major operations (i.e. DB Access) should not be handled within an event handler, and should be called in a separate method
*   Documentation comments should appear above each method indicating its purpose, parameters and return value
*   Implementation comments will be provided for explaining complex logic

### Exception Handling

*   A try catch block should be looking for a specific exception, not a general exception
*   The catch block should not be left empty
*   A try-catch block should enclose the entire method code, only the part that will throw an exception

### Others

*   _Create other categories if needed and list the criteria as bullet point_
