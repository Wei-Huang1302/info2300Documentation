## Abstract

_<Problem statement and rationale of your approach to solve the problem>_

_Ex., A need was perceived by the mangers at the Kitchener zoo to schedule feedings for the animals according to specified zoo personnel as animals sometimes went hungry with unfortunate results. The chief zookeeper and attendants were interviewed and requirements were gathered according to best industry practices. It was decided to create a desktop web application using ASP.NET as the client has appropriate licensing, and a partner mobile application using HTML 5 as this would result in maximum flexibility across devices and platforms. The system has been implemented and the client is now using it. There is potential for commercializing the application._

## Business/Technological Purpose

**<**_Provide a description of your system and how it is used._**\>**

_Ex., This system will allow zoo managers to create schedules for zoo personnel to feed animals. Personnel carrying handheld devices will use a mobile application to confirm the feedings have taken place or to flag them for rescheduling. (You might wish to include a screenshot here to give a stronger idea of how the system is used.)_
