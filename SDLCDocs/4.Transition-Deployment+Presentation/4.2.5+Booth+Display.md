Booth Display

Make a display board highlighting your projects’ features.

Display boards are available in stationary stores.

Example: [http://www.staples.ca/en/Quartet-Project-Presentation-Display-Board-48-x-36-/product\_40192\_2-CA\_1\_20001](http://www.staples.ca/en/Quartet-Project-Presentation-Display-Board-48-x-36-/product_40192_2-CA_1_20001)

This is an example that was also printed at a fedex store on foam-core. The materials were collated using an open source desktop publishing program Scribus. Scribus was set up to have a pages size equal to the board so that there wouldn’t be jaggies. We all went in on the foam-core board.
